### CPSC 120

[Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-06-mohammad-m-christy-h)

Lab 6 part 2 was one of my favorites as it was a fun experience coding a guessing game. In this lab we coded it to guess a number between one to hundred and had the answer state whether it was getting warmer or colder to the answer. We also used boolean variables to determine whether the answer is true it would keep the game going or it would stop the game.

Lab 8 part 3 was my second favorite from this semester as it dealt with creating code that would then make some animation.After working on the code, it was amazing to see the animations come to life such as the Godzilla one or the fireworks one. This was interesting to see how animations would be created in the 80/90s and would stop the animation in 2000 microseconds.

Lab 10 part 3 was my thirdfavorite lab from this semester as it was the first lab where we created our first image by coding. The image we had to code was colored images, and it depended on how much of a color gradient we put would affect the image's color. This was the first-time doing coding with colors which would make lab 12 much easier when we did code to create a gif.
